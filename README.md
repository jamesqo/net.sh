# sh.net

A couple of scripts that make it less painful to use Git Bash for .NET devs.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jamesqo/sh.net
cd sh.net
chmod a+rx install && ./install
```

The experience is best if you are running the shell as admin, since then you won't have to answer a bunch of UAC dialogs.
